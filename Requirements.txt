2. **`matplotlib`**: For data visualization.
3. **`pandas`**: For handling data in DataFrame structures.
4. **`seaborn`**: For enhanced visualizations and statistical plotting.
5. **`h5py`**: To handle HDF5 file formats.
6. **`scikit-learn`**: For machine learning metrics like `classification_report` and `confusion_matrix`.
7. **`kagglehub`**: To interact with Kaggle datasets.
8. **`keras`**: For building and training neural network models.
9. **`tensorflow`**: Backend for Keras and additional utilities like `to_categorical` and image preprocessing tools.
